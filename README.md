# 🌐 Language Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a simple **Language Detection** model using machine learning techniques in Python. Given a text input, the model predicts which language it's written in.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `language Detection.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🚀 Features

* Detects the language of a given sentence.
* Preprocessing techniques like tokenization and vectorization (e.g., CountVectorizer).
* Uses classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes) for prediction.
* Model evaluation using accuracy and classification report.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Numpy

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes texts in multiple languages. It's typically a collection of labeled sentences such as:

* English
* French
* Spanish
* German
* etc.

Dataset named : Language

## 📈 Sample Output

Example prediction:

```
Input: "Bonjour tout le monde"
Output: French
```
